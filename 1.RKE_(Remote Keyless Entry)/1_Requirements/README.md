# Abstract
- A Keyless Entry System allows the car to lock or unlock without the Mechenical key  
- The key fob doesn't need to be presented to  handle car body . it just needs to be within range for the sensors to pick up the signal
- Here in our Project this system is implemented using Led's 

# Introduction:

- Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles
- RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
- 1] Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
- 2] Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
- RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
- RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. 
- The Led's are used to work with the different operating conditions.





# Swot Analysis
## Strengths
- Remote Starting
- Time is saved during urgent situation
- Support for Effecient operation.

## Weakness
- cost of system may be increased
- complex System 
- issues of engine running after parking the car

## opportunities
- Advancement in Technology.


## Threats
- Targated Attacks
- Identity Theft

# 4W's And 1H

## Who??? 
- This system is used by people to lock/unlock car
## What??? 
- This is an keyless entry which can lock/unlock the cars without Mechanical key
## When??? 
- This system can be used whenever there is the need of locking/unlocking of car
## Where??? 
- This System can be used in Automotives
## How??? 
- This system works on buttons when lock button is pressed the car locks and if unlock button is pressed the car unlocks.
